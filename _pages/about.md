By Day I am a technical geek and researcher in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning. By Night I am an investment enthusiast in the field of value investing.

In my spare time, You can find me rollerblading along the riverside. I admit to have an insatiable hunger for pizzas and you can find me roaming around the city scouting for the best pizza joints. Furthermore, you can find my head burrowed in books hoping to find new perspectives on things, investing..

I am currently working as a NLP Scientist in  Taipei, Taiwan.
