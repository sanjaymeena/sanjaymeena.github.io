# Dealing with losing situations in stocks 



There are 3 behaviour types of investors in losing situations: 

## 1. The Rabbits : Caught in the capital impairment


### Mistakes made by Rabbits

#### 1. NaFF-Bee or 'Narrative Fallacy Framing Bias'
	
* When people make a decision they tend to reach a conclusion based on the way a problem has been presented. 
* Rabbits allow their favorite type of investment to dominate how they looked at a stock. 
* They also make up stories to positively explain losing situation. 

#### 2. Primacy Error

* This describes the way that first impressions have a lasting and disproportional effect on a person. 
* With the Rabbits, first impression is almost everything. 	


#### 3. Anchoring Bias

* When Rabits change their mind, its always an aching slow process. They are unwilling to accept new findings that they were wrong about the company and should get out of the position.

#### 4. Endowment Bias

* Large losses that happen over a short duration are almost impossible to accept, especially when they are substantial. It's easier to hold on to losing position than realise the loss by selling up. 
* The rabbits cannot bear the idea of crystallising a loss. They are too much aware of how much they paid for those losing shares. 
* Try not to be anchor to the purchase prices. 

#### 5. Following the Crowd

* Rabbits are rarely unique in the investments they made. Sadly, this is another reason they tended to persist with their mistake. 
* Trait of conforming to peer pressure is why most investors only invest at the end of the bull run. No one wants to be seen as the fool who stood on the side while his neighbours and friends were making vast fortunes. 
* The inner mental pressure to invest in stocks that you do not hold and that are going up is immense. 
* You have to constantly fight the urge to sell stocks that are hurting you. Feelings of pleasure, pain and fear go a long way to explaining investor actions and omissions. 

#### 6. Ego

* The Rabbits really didn't like being wrong. In fact , ultimately they are more interested in being right than making money. 
* When a rabbit defended a losing investment it reminds of Warren Buffet's famous saying: ' Forecast tell you little about the future but a lot about the forecaster'
* You should expect to be wrong at least half of the time. The very best investment minds are!

#### 7. Self Attribution Bias

* Rabbits blame others or external factors for their misfortunes but take full credit when things go well. It is one of the key reasons why we don't learn from past mistakes but keep repeating them. 

#### 8. The Wrong Information

* In losing situation, Rabbit would go on a mission to seek out more information to help make the right decision. Their focus will be on finding reasons to support the original recommendation.  

#### 9. Too big to fail/ Denomination Effect
* Denomination Effect : We find it easier to spend money if we have small denominations coins than when we have larger bank notes. The bigger the losing positions, the more nervous and indecisive most of us become. 

#### 10. Gambler's Fallacy
* Rabbits have a mistaken belief that the odds for a stock have become more *attractive* due to recent poor performance.
* It's a belief that we will win after a streak of losses roulette at the casino. 


### What the Rabbits could have done differently

The bad news is that everyone can be a Rabbit. The good news is , no one needs to be. There are few simple things they could have done to overcome their problems: 

#### 1. Always have a Plan

* When faced with painful loss making situations, most people do nothing. 
* Draw up a plan of precisely what actions you will take when your investments don't work. 


#### 2. Sell or buy more

* The only solution to a losing situation is to sell out or buy more. You have to materially adapt if you hope to survive and prosper.
* Doing nothing when you are losing is never an option. 


#### 3. Don't go all in 
* Never put yourself in a situation where you find out you are still convinced by your original investment idea but are not able to invest more money when the share price falls. That is poor money management. *Keep some dry powder*


#### 4. Don't be hasty to Jump in, do be hasty to jump out
* The winners make small mistake while the losers make big mistakes. 

#### 5. There is a difference being 'being right' and 'making money'
* Remember the saying: '*There is nothing like an idea whose time has come.*' In investing a lot of success can be attributed to being in the right place at the right time. 


#### 6. Seek out opposition
* Speak to someone with an opposing view.

#### 7. Be Humble

* Rabbits never say: '*I don't know*' Falling for your own hype can also lead to mistake that the least intelligent person in the world would not be capable of.
* The markets can be right even when everyone who make it up is indiviually wrong.


#### 8. Keep quiet and carry on 
* Be careful who you talk to about your investments and how you talk to them. Some people have an almost religious zeal for shares they have bought and like nothing better than sharing their views in public to as many people as possible. Unfortunately, this make it impossible to walk away from an idea without looking like an idiot. 
* George Soros : Theory of Reflexivity: 
	* Markets cannot possibly discount the future correctly  because they do not merely discount the future; they also help to shape it.

#### 9. Don't underestimate the downside, adapt to it. 

#### 10. Be open to different kinds of story
* Many studies have shown the stocks with the worst stories tend to produce the highest returns. 

#### 11. Get sick of sick notes
* Familiarise yourself with all the well-worn excuse in advance so that you waste no time trying to fool yourself or anyone else persisting with a mistake. Below are some of the excuses: 
	* The 'If only' excuse
	* The 'I would have been right but for' defense
	* The 'It just hasn't happened yet'
	* The 'Who could have foreseen at the time I invested that XYZ would happen..' defense

#### 12. Be suspicious of status

* It is dangerous to assume that just because an investment professional is highly educated and has years of experience , he or she will be good at making money and getting the big calls right. 

#### Capital Impairment
* Ambiguity aversion
	* People prefer to stick with intolerable situations merely because an hypothetical alternative might be worse. Better the devil you know. 
* To maximize profits you have to minimize losses. You must preserve your capital.
