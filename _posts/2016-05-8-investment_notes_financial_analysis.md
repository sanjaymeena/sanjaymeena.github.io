# Balance Sheet Analysis 

In simple terms, balance sheet discloses what a business owns and what it owes at a specific point in time.

Assets=Liabilities + Equity


## Equity 

Equity is divided into : 


### 1. Share capital

Suppose a company were to issue 500 new shares in an IPO. The shares have a face value of 5 and IPO Price of 100.  
Here is how the addition is made to equity: 

* 5 of face value * 500 shares =2500 will be added to share capital. 
* Share premium (100 -5)* 100=47500 will be added to reserves and surplus under share premium reserves


### 2. Reserves and surplus

1. General reserves
	*  Consist of profit which company has not distributed among shareholders. 

2. Surplus
   * This is where company adds its annual profit straight from the income statement, again before distributing any money as dividends to shareholders, but not allocated to any specific purpose. 


Equity capital is the ultimate determinant of a company's borrowing capacity. 

## Assets

## Liabilities

###  Non Current Liabilities

#### Long term liabilities

Obligations due more than 1 year into future. 

#### Deferred Tax liabilities
 
They arise due to difference between profit as per the company's act and as per the income tax act

The main reasons are : 

1. Depreciation

	Consider an example: 
	  Assume a company buys machine for Rs 10 crore. The depreciation that can be claimed in the company's account as per companies act is say 20% . The depreciation as per income tax act is 50%. 
	  
	The deferred tax liability calculation would be calculated for the first year: 

	* Value of a machine = 10 crore
	* Depreciation as per companies act = 20% * 10 crore = Rs 2 crore
	* Depreciation as per income tax act=  50% * 10 crore= Rs 5 crore
	* Difference =  2-5= -3 crore
	* Differed tax liability @30% tax rate= 3 * 30% = .9 crore
	* 0.9 crore of deferred tax is something which company has to pay up in the future as is thus a liability.


#### Long term provisions
 
Money that is provided for future liabilities

#### Long term borrowings

Loan and financial obligations that last over one year. 


### Current Liabilities 

Liabilities due in less than one year. 


1. Trade payables/Account payables

	Represents amount a business owes its vendors for goods and services .

2. Other current liabilities

	Short term payables not directly related to the main business of the company

3. Short term provisions

	Money that is provided for a liability that is expected to occur within one year. 


4. Short term borrowings

Loans and financial obligations due within one year. 


Point to note: 

* Don't take too much note of current liabilities other than spot large changes or trends. 
* High current liabilities can result in higher effective returns on capital with relatively low cost and risk. 


### Minority Interest

* Only occurs in consolidated balance sheet (that combines the account of a company and its subsidiaries)
* Minority interest represents the portion of consolidated subsidiaries owned by others. 

E.g. Say Tata motors owns 85% of JLR, which becomes the former's subsidiaries. 

* Now 100% of JLR's assets and liabilities would be included in the consolidated balance sheet of TM. 
* Minority interest would represent the 15% of the net assets of JLR not owned by TM. 




# Ratio Categories : 
 
* Activity
* Liquidity
* Solvency
* Profitability
* Valuation



## Activity Ratios 

### Inventory:

* Inventory Turnover = cost of goods sold/average inventory
	* Higher the inventory turnover ratio, the shorter is the period that inventory is held. 

* Inventory Days= number of days in a period/ inventory turnover


### Receivables : 

* Receivables turnover = revenue / average receivables 
* Receivables days = number of days in a period / Receivable turnover


### Payables : 

*  Payables turnover = costs of good sold / average trade payables
* Payables days = number of days in a period /payable turnover 

###	Working Capital : 

* Working capital turnover= revenue / average working capital 

### Asset :

*  Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average net fixed assets
*  Total Asset Turnover = Revenue/ Average total assets


## Liquidity Ratios :

* Liquidity measures how quickly assets are converted into cash
* They also measure  a company's ability to pay off its short-term obligations

### Current ratio:
current ratio= current assets/ Current liabilities. 

### Quick ratio/ Acid test ratio :
* (Cash+ Current investments + Receivables ) /Current liabilities

### Cash ratio  :
* (cash + current investments) / current liabilities

### Cash conversion cycle :
* (Inventory days + receivables days - payable days)

###  Debt Ratios
			 
#### Debt to Asset

#### Debt to Capital

#### Debt to Equity

### Coverage Ratios

#### Financial Leverage

#### Interest Coverage

## Profitability Ratios

### Return on Sales

####  Gross Profit Margin

####  Operating Profit Margin

####  Net Profit Margin

## Return on Investment

### Return on Assets

# Financial Shenanigans

## Earning manipulation Shenanigans

### 1. Recording revenue too soon or Recording bogus revenue

* Rate of change in receivables vs rate of change in revenues
* Lower growth in operating cash flows than in operating profits
* Receivable days ratio

### 1. Shifting current expenses to a later period
* Look for R&D expenses in a company's financial statements and check how much of that is capitalized
* Compare the depreciation rates charged by a company on its various assets with that of its competitors

### 2.  "Managing" Earnings using big bath accounting

* Look out for "big bath" charges during difficult times.
* There is no better times to record huge charges than when the market is in a downturn. 

### 3. Other Shenanigans to manage earnings

1. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities

	* turning sale of a business into a recurring revenue stream
	* shifting normal expenses below the line
		* shifting non-operating and non-recurring income below the line 


2. Shifting current income to a later period

	* Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period
	* Recording current-period sales in  a later period

### 4. Warning Checklist

These points are relevant to how companies manipulate their revenues and profits

* Receivables that are rising faster than sales or simply receivables rising at a faster pace 
* Rising receivables days - this may suggest that the revenue increase might have been achieved by relaxing credit terms
* Cash flow from operations (CFO) lower than operating and/or net profit for many years in the past - warning for premature revenue recognition
* Capitalization of  high proportion of R&D Expenses
* Depreciating rates charged by a company on it various assets and compare with that of its competitors to ensure that there are no big disparities
* Company depreciating its fixed assets too slowly (thereby creating a boost to income) , especially in industries that are experiencing rapid technological advances. 
* Big bath expenses during difficult times. 
* Sharp rise in profits just after a downturn. The company may have used big bath accounting in the previous year. 
* Boost in income using one-time or unsustainable activities. 
* Boost in income using one-time events
* Company turning proceeds from the sale of business into a recurring revenue stream. 
* Shift in normal operating expenses below the line 
* Company routinely recording restructuring charges 
* Company including proceeds received from selling a subsidiary as revenue. 
* Company creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period. 
* Sudden and unexplained declines in deferred revenue. 
* Unexpectedly consistent earnings during a volatile time. 
* Signs of revenue being held back by the target just before an acquisition closes



### 5.  General things to be vary of  : 

* IPOs - Most promoters  and investment bankers connive to con you
* Businesses that are difficult to understand
* Business with a lot of regulations
* Companies making a lot of acquisitions
* Companies frequently demerging/selling its business divisions
* Real estate and construction companies 
* Banks and financial institutions
* Companies with political connections
* Companies from business groups like Reliance, Sterling, Adan i
* Companies based out of hyderabad


## Cash flow Shenanigans
*  Shifting financial cash inflows to the operating section
* Shifting normal operating cash outflows to the investing section

* Inflating operating cash flows using acquisitions
	* Companies that make numerous acquisitions
	* Declining free cash flows while CFO appears to be strong

* Corporate Governance
	*  Do appropriate checks and balances exist among senior executives to snuff out corporate misdeeds
	* Do outside members of the board play a meaningful role in protecting investors from greedy , misguided, or incompetent management? 
	* Do the auditors possess the independence, knowledge, and determination to protect investors when management act inappropriately? 

	* Has the company improperly taken circuitous steps to avoid regulatory scrutiny? 
	* Boards lacking competence or independence
	* Failure to challenge management on related party transactions
	* Be wary of companies where a single person dominates the management and board? 
	* Be skeptical of boastful or promotional management
	* Astronomical fees lead to conflicted independent auditors


## Conclusion - Red flags

* Sharp jumps in receivables ,especially long term and unbilled.
* Cash flows from operations materially lags behind net income.
* Be wary of companies using percentage of completion method (especially engineering and construction company), as there are more chances of using aggressive assumptions.
* Watch out if non-recurring expenses/extra ordinary expenses have been recurring. 
* Do not get excited by the results of a company for few quarters after it has written off certain assets, as it is possible that it is the result of writing down good inventory or assets. 
* Watch out for companies which try to include non-core income to boost operating margins in times of stress  or economic slowdown
* Increase in capex, without corresponding increase in sales indicate that the company might be capitalizing normal operating expenses. 
* Rapidly growing fixed asset account or "soft" asset accounts (e.g. "other assets") may be  a sign of aggressive capitalization. Create a quarterly common-size balance sheet (i.e. calculate all assets and liabilities as a percentage of total assets) to quickly identify assets that are growing faster than the rest of the Balance Sheet.
* Inflating revenue right after closing on an acquisition is a pretty simple trick - once the merger is announced, instructs the target company to hold back revenue until after the merger closes. 
* Look out in the notes to account for disclosure regarding securitization or factoring of receivables. 
* Be wary of serial acquirers, as its difficult to understand operating cash flow. 
* Auditors rarely disagree with management , so if they do disagree with management on transaction of significant magnitude , in all possibility it gives indication of some wrong doing.
