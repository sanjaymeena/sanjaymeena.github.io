	* Assets=Liabilities + Equity
	* Equity
	* 
		* Divided into 
		* 
			* Share capital
			* 
				* Suppose a company were to issue 500 new shares in an IPO. The shares have a face value of 5 and IPO Price of 100.  Here is how the addition is made to equity: 
				* 
					* 5 of face value * 500 shares =2500 will be added to share capital
					* Share premium (100 -5)* 100=47500 will be added to reserves and surplus under share premium reserves


			* Reserves and surplus
			* 
				* General reserves
				* 
					* Consist of profit which company has not distributed among shareholders. 

				* Surplus
				* 
					* This is where company adds its annual profit straight from the income statement, again before distributing any money as dividends to shareholders, but not allocated to any specific purpose. 



			* Notes: 
			* 
				* Equity capital is the ultimate determinant of a company's borrowing capacity. 



	* Non Current Liabilities
	* 
		* Long term liabilities


		* 
			* Obligations due more than 1 year into future. 

		* Deferred Tax liabilities
		* 
			* They arise due to difference between profit as per the company's act and as per the income tax act
			* The main reasons are : 
			* 
				* Depreciation
				* Example: 
				* 
					* Assume a company buys machine for Rs 10 crore. The depreciation that can be claimed in the company's account as per companies act is say 20% . The depreciation as per income tax act is 50%. 
					* The deferred tax liability calculation would be calculated for the first year: 
					* 
						* Value of a machine = 10 crore
						* Depreciation as per companies act = 20% * 10 crore = Rs 2 crore
						* Depreciation as per income tax act=  50% * 10 crore= Rs 5 crore
						* Difference =  2-5= -3 crore
						* Differed tax liability @30% tax rate= 3 * 30% = .9 crore
						* 0.9 crore of deferred tax is something which company has to pay up in the future as is thus a liability.




		* Long term provisions
		* 
			* Money that is provided for future liabilities

		* Long term borrowings
		* 
			* Loan and financial obligations that last over one year. 


	* Current Liabilities : Liabilities due in less than one year. 
	* 
		* Trade payables/Account payables
		* 
			* Represents amount a business owes its vendors for goods and services .

		* Other current liabilities
		* 
			* Short term payables not directly related to the main business of the company

		* Short term provisions
		* 
			* Money that is provided for a liability that is expected to occur within one year. 


		* Short term borrowings
		* 
			* Loans and financial obligations due within one year. 

		* Note: 
		* 
			* Don't take too much note of current liabilities other than spot large changes or trends. 
			* High current liabilities can result in higher effective returns on capital with relatively low cost and risk. 


	* Minority Interest
	* 
		* Only occurs in consolidated balance sheet (that combines the account of a company and its subsidiaries)
		* Minority interest represents the portion of consolidated subsidiaries owned by others. 
		* 
			* E.g. Say Tata motors owns 85% of JLR, which becomes the former's subsidiaries. 
			* 
				* Now 100% of JLR's assets and liabilities would be included in the consolidated balance sheet of TM. 
				* Minority interest would represent the 15% of the net assets of JLR not owned by TM.

		* Inventory:
		* 
			* Inventory Turnover = cost of goods sold/average inventory
			* 
				* Higher the inventory turnover ratio, the shorter is the period that inventory is held. 


			* Inventory Days= number of days in a period/ inventory turnover


		* Receivables : 
		* 
			* Receivables turnover = revenue / average receivables

			* Current ratio:
			* 
				* current assets/ Current liabilities.

		* Financial Shenanigans
		* 
			* Earning manipulation Shenanigans
			* 
				* Recording revenue too soon or Recording bogus revenue
				* 
					* Rate of change in receivables vs rate of change in revenues
					* Lower growth in operating cash flows than in operating profits
					* Receivable days ratio

				* Shifting current expenses to a later period
				* 
					* Look for R&D expenses in a company's financial statements and check how much of that is capitalized
					* Compare the depreciation rates charged by a company on its various assets with that of its competitors

				* "Managing" Earnings using big bath accounting
				* 
					* Look out for "big bath" charges during difficult times.
					* 
						* There is no better times to record huge charges than when the market is in a downturn. 


				* Other Shenanigans to manage earnings
				* 
					1. Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities

						* turning sale of a business into a recurring revenue stream
						* shifting normal expenses below the line
						* 
							* shifting non-operating and non-recurring income below the line 


					2. Shifting current income to a later period

						* Creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period
						* Recording current-period sales in  a later period


				* Warning Checklist
				* 
					* These points are relevant to how companies manipulate their revenues and profits
					* 
						* Receivables that are rising faster than sales or simply receivables rising at a faster pace 

						* Rising receivables days - this may suggest that the revenue increase might have been achieved by relaxing credit terms
						* Cash flow from operations (CFO) lower than operating and/or net profit for many years in the past - warning for premature revenue recognition
						* Capitalization of  high proportion of R&D Expenses
						* Depreciating rates charged by a company on it various assets and compare with that of its competitors to ensure that there are no big disparities

						* Company depreciating its fixed assets too slowly (thereby creating a boost to income) , especially in industries that are experiencing rapid technological advances. 
						* Big bath expenses during difficult times. 
						* Sharp rise in profits just after a downturn. The company may have used big bath accounting in the previous year. 
						* Boost in income using one-time or unsustainable activities. 
						* Boost in income using one-time events
						* Company turning proceeds from the sale of business into a recurring revenue stream. 
						* Shift in normal operating expenses below the line 

						* Company routinely recording restructuring charges 
						* Company including proceeds received from selling a subsidiary as revenue. 
						* Company creating reserves and releasing them into income in a later period. 
						* Sudden and unexplained declines in deferred revenue. 
						* Unexpectedly consistent earnings during a volatile time. 
						* Signs of revenue being held back by the target just before an acquisition closes



				* Be Wary of : 
				* 
					*  IPOs - Most promoters  and investment bankers connive to con you
					* Businesses that are difficult to understand
					* Business with a lot of regulations
					* Companies making a lot of acquisitions
					* Companies frequently demerging/selling its business divisions
					*  Real estate and construction companies 
					* Banks and financial institutions
					* Companies with political connections
					* Companies from business groups like Reliance, Sterling, Adan i
					* Companies based out of hyderabad


			* Cash flow Shenanigans
			* 
				*  Shifting financial cash inflows to the operating section
				* Shifting normal operating cash outflows to the investing section

				* Inflating operating cash flows using acquisitions
				* 
					* Companies that make numerous acquisitions
					* Declining free cash flows while CFO appears to be strong

				* Corporate Governance
				* 
					*  Do appropriate checks and balances exist among senior executives to snuff out corporate misdeeds
					* Do outside members of the board play a meaningful role in protecting investors from greedy , misguided, or incompetent management? 
					* Do the auditors possess the independence, knowledge, and determination to protect investors when management act inappropriately? 

					* Has the company improperly taken circuitous steps to avoid regulatory scrutiny? 
					* Boards lacking competence or independence
					* Failure to challenge management on related party transactions
					* Be wary of companies where a single person dominates the management and board? 
					* Be skeptical of boastful or promotional management
					* Astronomical fees lead to conflicted independent auditors


			* Conclusion - Red flags
			* 
				* Sharp jumps in receivables ,especially long term and unbilled.
				* Cash flows from operations materially lags behind net income.
				* Be wary of companies using percentage of completion method (especially engineering and construction company), as there are more chances of using aggressive assumptions.
				* Watch out if non-recurring expenses/extra ordinary expenses have been recurring. 
				* Do not get excited by the results of a company for few quarters after it has written off certain assets, as it is possible that it is the result of writing down good inventory or assets. 
				* Watch out for companies which try to include non-core income to boost operating margins in times of stress  or economic slowdown
				* Increase in capex, without corresponding increase in sales indicate that the company might be capitalizing normal operating expenses. 
				* Rapidly growing fixed asset account or "soft" asset accounts (e.g. "other assets") may be  a sign of aggressive capitalization. Create a quarterly common-size balance sheet (i.e. calculate all assets and liabilities as a percentage of total assets) to quickly identify assets that are growing faster than the rest of the Balance Sheet.
				* Inflating revenue right after closing on an acquisition is a pretty simple trick - once the merger is announced, instructs the target company to hold back revenue until after the merger closes. 
				* Look out in the notes to account for disclosure regarding securitization or factoring of receivables. 
				* Be wary of serial acquirers, as its difficult to understand operating cash flow. 
				* Auditors rarely disagree with management , so if they do disagree with management on transaction of significant magnitude , in all possibility it gives indication of some wrong doing.
