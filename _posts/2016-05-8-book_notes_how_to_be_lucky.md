* It simply means, make contact with people. Get involved. Plunge into the events yourself. All the time, make your career goals known to those you meet.
* The big breaks flow through contacts between people. 
	* The worst thing that you can do is withdraw from the network of friendships and acquaintanceships	at home and at work.
