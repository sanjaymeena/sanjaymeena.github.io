* Lower growth in operating cash flows than in operating profits
* Receivable days ratio

### 1. Shifting current expenses to a later period
* Look for R&D expenses in a company's financial statements and check how much of that is capitalized
* Compare the depreciation rates charged by a company on its various assets with that of its competitors

### 2.  "Managing" Earnings using big bath accounting

### 4. Warning Checklist

These points are relevant to how companies manipulate their revenues and profits

* Receivables that are rising faster than sales or simply receivables rising at a faster pace 
* Rising receivables days - this may suggest that the revenue increase might have been achieved by relaxing credit terms
* Cash flow from operations (CFO) lower than operating and/or net profit for many years in the past - warning for premature revenue recognition
* Capitalization of  high proportion of R&D Expenses
* Depreciating rates charged by a company on it various assets and compare with that of its competitors to ensure that there are no big disparities
* Company depreciating its fixed assets too slowly (thereby creating a boost to income) , especially in industries that are experiencing rapid technological advances. 
* Big bath expenses during difficult times. 
* Sharp rise in profits just after a downturn. The company may have used big bath accounting in the previous year. 
* Boost in income using one-time or unsustainable activities.

* Shifting normal operating cash outflows to the investing section

* Inflating operating cash flows using acquisitions
	* Companies that make numerous acquisitions
	* Declining free cash flows while CFO appears to be strong

* Corporate Governance
	*  Do appropriate checks and balances exist among senior executives to snuff out corporate misdeeds
	* Do outside members of the board play a meaningful role in protecting investors from greedy , misguided, or incompetent management? 
	* Do the auditors possess the independence, knowledge, and determination to protect investors when management act inappropriately? 

	* Has the company improperly taken circuitous steps to avoid regulatory scrutiny? 
	* Boards lacking competence or independence
	* Failure to challenge management on related party transactions
	* Be wary of companies where a single person dominates the management and board? 
	* Be skeptical of boastful or promotional management
	* Astronomical fees lead to conflicted independent auditors


## Conclusion - Red flags

* Sharp jumps in receivables ,especially long term and unbilled.
* Cash flows from operations materially lags behind net income.
* Be wary of companies using percentage of completion method (especially engineering and construction company), as there are more chances of using aggressive assumptions.
* Watch out if non-recurring expenses/extra ordinary expenses have been recurring. 
* Do not get excited by the results of a company for few quarters after it has written off certain assets, as it is possible that it is the result of writing down good inventory or assets. 
* Watch out for companies which try to include non-core income to boost operating margins in times of stress  or economic slowdown
* Increase in capex, without corresponding increase in sales indicate that the company might be capitalizing normal operating expenses. 
* Rapidly growing fixed asset account or "soft" asset accounts (e.g. "other assets") may be  a sign of aggressive capitalization. Create a quarterly common-size balance sheet (i.e. calculate all assets and liabilities as a percentage of total assets) to quickly identify assets that are growing faster than the rest of the Balance Sheet.
* Inflating revenue right after closing on an acquisition is a pretty simple trick - once the merger is announced, instructs the target company to hold back revenue until after the merger closes. 
* Look out in the notes to account for disclosure regarding securitization or factoring of receivables. 
* Be wary of serial acquirers, as its difficult to understand operating cash flow. 
* Auditors rarely disagree with management , so if they do disagree with management on transaction of significant magnitude , in all possibility it gives indication of some wrong doing.
